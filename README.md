Gmail: Create a Google Cloud project, enable the Gmail API, and set up OAuth 2.0 credentials. Integrate OAuth into your TypeScript application using the Google APIs client library to handle user authentication and access tokens.
Outlook: Register your app on the Azure Portal to obtain OAuth credentials. Use the Microsoft Graph API in your TypeScript application to manage the OAuth flow and access Outlook email data.
I have developed a machine learning algorithm that utilizes reinforcement learning, leveraging labeled data for training. The dataset is split into two parts: 80% is used for training, and the remaining 20% is reserved for testing. Initially, the dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize data, and convert categorical variables into numerical formats if necessary. Once the data is preprocessed, it is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio. The reinforcement learning environment is then defined, which includes the states, actions, and rewards, enabling the agent to interact with the environment to learn optimal policies. The model is trained using the training dataset, where it iteratively updates its policy based on the rewards received from the environment. Finally, the trained model is evaluated using the testing dataset, assessing its performance with various metrics to ensure its efficacy and accuracy.
